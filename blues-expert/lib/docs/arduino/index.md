# Getting Started

The Arduino Library, note-arduino, is a library for interacting with the Notecard.
It is a wrapper around the note-c library and provides a native Arduino interface for interacting with the Notecard.

This library is recommended for Arduino-based devices, in particular those that use the Arduino IDE/CLI for project management, building, and flashing.

## Installing the note-arduino library

### Arduino CLI

```bash
arduino-cli lib install "Blues Wireless Notecard"
