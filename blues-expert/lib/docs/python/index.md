# Getting Started

The Python SDK, note-python, is a library for interacting with the Notecard.
It is a wrapper around the Notecard API and provides a more fluent Pythonic interface for interacting with the Notecard.

This library is recommended for high-level interactions with the Notecard, such as from a Raspberry Pi or other Linux-based device.
Support for CircuitPython and MicroPython is also available.

## Installing the note-python SDK

```bash
pip install note-python
```
