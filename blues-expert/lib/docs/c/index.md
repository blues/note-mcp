# Getting Started

The C Library, note-c, is an SDK for interacting with the Notecard.
It is a native C interface for interacting with the Notecard and supports the Notecard's transport protocols, including I2C, and UART.

This library is recommended for vendor HAL projects or bare metal projects, where a user might wish to a vendor-specific HAL for the Notecard.
Examples are provided for using the STM32 HAL and the FreeRTOS operating system.

## Installing the note-c library

Download the latest release from the [note-c GitHub Repository](https://github.com/blues/note-c/releases).

Add the library to your project's include path.
